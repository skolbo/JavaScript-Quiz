Timed quiz built on Javascript Funamentals storing high scores. Clicking the Begin button starts the countdown and presents questions going forward. If a question is answered a new one will appear. If the question is incorrect than time is taken from the clock. After all questions are answered or if the countdown reaches zero than its game over. Afterwards the player is able to enter their initals to see the score. They are then able to click Retry in which the game will start over, or they can click save in which the page redirects to the welcome page again.
